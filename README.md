You can find the project's requirements [here](https://www.notion.so/Platform-game-4a55a7d1fcc245bcb012c76814764712).

Kindly check my Game Design Document: [GDD](Game-design-document.md)

In this project I:

- Used Javascript and Phaser 3 to implement a Shooter Game.
- Used the following packages apart from the standard ones:
  - phaser
  - webpack
  - jest
- Set up ESlint in the repository.
- Created effective JavaScript code, that solved the problem.
- Used Webpack.
- Used ES6+.
- Dealt with async code.
- Tested the code using Jest.
- Sent and received data from a back-end endpoint.
- Used JSON format.
- Deployed the app to Netlify.
- Translated business requirements into software solutions.
- Communicated information effectively to technical people.

# How to play

- When the App is executed, you will see four buttons:
  - Start: Starts the game
  - Scores: Allows you to check the high scores leaderboard
  - Credits: Shows you the credits scene

- When the game starts, the story's intro will be played
- Then you will be able to control the warrior with up and right ARROW keys to move
- Try to collect as many coins as you can!
- If you get hit by a bat or fall off the platform, It will be game over.
- Get a bonus score if you pass all the platforms alive.

## Built with
